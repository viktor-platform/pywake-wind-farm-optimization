# Welcome to wind farm modelling with PyWake! ðŸ’¨
With this app you can design a wind farm in a few steps.

Start by selecting an area for your wind farm by drawing a polygon on the map.

In order to keep the current problem manageable, the area of your windfarm $A$ should satisfy
$$
{SITE_MINIMUM_AREA} < A < {SITE_MAXIMUM_AREA}
        """
        + r"""
\ ({\textrm{km}^2})
$$
Note that one of the biggest off-shore wind farms, known as the [Hornsea Wind Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsea_Wind_Farm)
covers an area of almost 5000 $\textrm{km}^2$! Typically speaking wind farms are a couple hundreds of squared kilometers. Some 
examples include:
- [Walney Wind Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walney_Wind_Farm) (~80 $\textrm{km}^2$);
- [Triton Knoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_Knoll) (~200 $\textrm{km}^2$);
- [Borssele Offshore Wind Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borssele_Offshore_Wind_Farm) (~300 $\textrm{km}^2$).

## Turbines 
Try to keep the follwing in mind, while designing your wind farm:

but allows for a lower total number of turbines and increases wake effects;
- Additionally, turbines are typically spaced several multiples of their diameter away from each other. 
Increasing this spacing reduces wake effects as well as the total number of turbines and AEP.

Many factors come into play when optmizing your wind farm's layout. The previous step
illustrates how this can complicate finding the most efficient and profitable wind farm.
Luckily, we can use the [Topfarm module](https://topfarm.pages.windenergy.dtu.dk/TopFarm2/) 
to automatically find optimal positions for the wind turbines. This 
optimization considers the wake effects resulting from the wind conditions at your chosen site.

By pressing the optimization button below you can further improve on your wind farm's layout.
After the routine has finished, you can update the "Optimized positions" view on the right to see 
the recommended changes!

Optimization can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the number of turbines
and iterations. Below you can alter the number of iterations to your liking
