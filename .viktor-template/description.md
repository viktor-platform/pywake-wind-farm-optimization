This sample app demonstrates how to optimize wind farm layouts.

The goal of this app is to showcase various analyses and optimizations for wind farm design using VIKTOR. Developed with the help of the open-source libraries [PyWake](https://topfarm.pages.windenergy.dtu.dk/PyWake/) to model-  and [TopFarm](https://topfarm.pages.windenergy.dtu.dk/TopFarm2/) to optimize your custom wind farm

In this application, the following functionalities are demonstrated:
- Defining and visualizing the site boundary on a map.
- Obtaining up-to-date wind distribution data via [Globla Wind Atlas](https://globalwindatlas.info/en) API.
- Simulating and visualizing wind patterns and wake effects.
- Optimizing turbine positions to maximize Annual Energy Production (AEP).
- Displaying detailed results, including wind rose plots, wake plots, and optimized turbine layouts.

A published version of this app is available on [VITKOR's demo environment](https://demo.viktor.ai/public/wind-farm-design-with-pywake)
